Goldman a fan of trust banks, exchanges on expectation of higher volatility
Analyst Alexander Blostein raises the trust banks (STT, BK, NTRS) to attractive and upgrades State Street (STT +2.1%) to Buy from Neutral. He sees 2017 as bringing an inflection point in the banks' high-margin revenue streams, with currency trading set to recover amid thanks to rising global uncertainty.
He also sees "room to run" in the exchanges, and gives CBOE Holdings (CBOE +1.5%) a two-notch upgrade to Buy. ICE and Virtu Financial (NASDAQ:VIRT) remain top picks.
Turning to alternative investment managers, Blostein wonders if they could lead this year after lagging in 2016. He upgrades Apollo Global (NYSE:APO) to Buy, and it, along with Oaktree (NYSE:OAK) and Blackstone (NYSE:BX) are top picks.
It's the same old story for traditional asset managers, and Blostein remains negative. He downgrades Artisan Partners (APAM -3.3%) to Sell and BlackRock (BLK -0.5%) to Neutral. Affiliated Managers (AMG +0.1%) is pulled from the Conviction List.

Ionis Pharma's T2D candidate shows positive action in mid-stage study
Results from a Phase 2 study assessing Ionis Pharmaceuticals' (NASDAQ:IONS) IONIS-GCGRrx in 79 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) showed statistically significant improvements in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and other measures of glucose control after 26 weeks of treatment.
Subjects receiving 50 mg and 75 mg of IONIS-GCGRrx once weekly achieved reductions from baseline in HbA1c of 0.7% (p<0.05) and 1.4% (p<0.001), respectively, compared to 0.1% for placebo. At baseline, average HbA1c levels were ~8.8% for all cohorts.
50 mg was identified as the optimal dose since it produced robust HbA1c reductions without the unwanted side effects of liver enzyme elevations, increases in LDL-cholesterol or blood pressure. The most common adverse event observed was injection site reaction (4.4%).
IONIS-GCGRrx is a next-generation antisense drug designed to reduce the production glucagon receptor (GCGR). Glucagon is a hormone that opposes the action of insulin and stimulates the liver to produce glucose, especially in T2D.
The company intends to advance IONIS-GCGRrx into Phase 3 development.
Management will host a conference call tomorrow at 9:30 am ET to discuss its pipeline progress.
